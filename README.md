## What is WhatIsIt?
WhatIsIt is a Swift 4 iOS app I made, using the `CoreML` and `Vision` frameworks and the `Inceptionv3 Neural Network Classifier`. The app will enable you yo capture an image using the camera or use an existing image from your photos folder, and let you know if is it an 'X'. 'X' can be set by changing the value of the `imageQuery` variable.
